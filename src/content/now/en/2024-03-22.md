description: Organized my desktop for a better workspace and continued developing 'vite-react-ssg' and plugins for powertoys-run..

## Desktop

I spent some time organizing my desktop workspace and got a small desktop charging station, which allows me to charge my watch, phone, and headphones with minimal wires. Now my desktop is clean and tidy, and I hope it will create a more pleasant working environment for me.

## Personal Development

[vite-react-ssg](https://github.com/Daydreamer-riri/vite-react-ssg) still doesn't have support for [Tanstack router](https://tanstack.com/router/latest)...
Lately, I've been obsessed with writing plugins for powertoys-run. I hope it becomes more useful and catches up with raycas.
