I recently discovered that `react-transition-group` does not support FLIP list animations (in contrast, VUE's built-in `TransitionGroup` does). 
So how should we implement a beautiful list animation in the world of React? This article will explain my exploration process.

## Framer Motion

`framer-motion` is an excellent animation library, its API design is very elegant, it can be said to be the best in React animation libraries,
and it is currently the most popular React animation library.

FLIP transitions in `framer-motion` are supported by the `positionTransition` property.
The `framer-motion` official provides a Notifications example, from which we can see how to use `positionTransition` to implement list animations.

> link: [framer-motion Notifications](https://codesandbox.io/s/framer-motion-notifications-5cvo9)

The core code is as follows:

```tsx
import React, { useState } from 'react'
import { AnimatePresence, motion } from 'framer-motion'
import { CloseButton, remove, add } from './utils'

export default function App() {
  const [notifications, setNotifications] = useState([0])

  return (
    <div className="container">
      <ul>
        <AnimatePresence initial={false}>
          {notifications.map(id => (
            <motion.li
              key={id}
              positionTransition  // <--- positionTransition
              initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 50, scale: 0.3 }}
              animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0, scale: 1 }}
              exit={{ opacity: 0, scale: 0.5, transition: { duration: 0.2 } }}
            >
              <CloseButton
                close={() => setNotifications(remove(notifications, id))}
              />
            </motion.li>
          ))}
        </AnimatePresence>
      </ul>
      <button
        className="add"
        onClick={() => setNotifications(add(notifications))}
      >
        +
      </button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

After specifying `positionTransition`, `framer-motion` will automatically calculate the position of the current element when it changes,
and then implement the animation through `transform` and `opacity`.

<ListAnimationFramerMotion client:only="react" />

## View Transition

But sometimes we don't want to use `framer-motion` because it's quite large in size.
With the `view transition api`, we can easily implement list animations without introducing external libraries.

Simply put, the `view transition api` can automatically implement transitions for changes in elements with the same `view-transition-name` in `document.startViewTransition`.

We can start to modify the `framer-motion` example, replace `motion.li` with a regular `li`, and specify `view-transition-name`.

```tsx
// ...
  <ul>
    {notifications.map(id => (
      <li
        key={id}
        // In css, view-transition-name applies this variable
        style={{ "--transition-name": `tn-${ id } ` }} 
        id={`li-${ id }`}
      >
        <CloseButton
          close={() => setNotifications(remove(notifications, id))}
        />
      </motion.li>
    ))}
  </ul>
```

Next, since the `view transition api` requires all changes to be completed in the callback of `document.startViewTransition`,
we need to wrap the state changes in ReactDom's `flushSync`:

```tsx
import { flushSync } from 'react-dom'

// Close button
  <CloseButton
    close={() => {
      document.startViewTransition(() =>
        flushSync(() => setNotifications(remove(notifications, id)))
      );
    }}
  />

// Add button
  <button
    className="add"
    onClick={() => {
      document.startViewTransition(() => {
        flushSync(() => {
          setNotifications(add(notifications));
        });
      });
    }}
  >
    +
  </button>
```

At this point, you already have a list animation that is no worse than `framer-motion`.

In the `framer-motion` example, there is also a scaling animation when the card exits. Currently, our example fades out by default when the card exits.
We can set a new `view-transition-name` for the element that is about to exit when exiting, and then specify a scaling animation for this `view-transition-name` in css.

```tsx
<CloseButton
  close={() => {
    const li = document.getElementById(`li-${ id }`);
    li.style['view-transition-name'] = "tn-out";
    document.startViewTransition(() =>
      flushSync(() => setNotifications(remove(notifications, id)))
    );
  }}
/>
```

```scss
// :only-child represents that there is only view-transition-old and no view-transition-new
::view-transition-old(tn-out):only-child {
  animation: scale-out .3s forwards;
}
```

We can also set an entrance animation for the card:

```scss
li {
  view-transition-name: var(--transition-name);
  animation: scale-in .3s;
}

@keyframes scale-in {
  from {
    opacity: 0;
    transform: translateY(50px) scale(0.3);
  }
  to {
    opacity: 1;
    transform: translateY(0) scale(1);
  }
}
```

The effect is as follows:

<ListAnimationViewTransition client:only="react" />

## Conclusion

The `view transition api` is a very excellent API, it allows us to implement beautiful list animations without introducing external libraries.
But currently, it has some compatibility issues (chrome 111+), so be careful when using it in actual projects.
The effects it can achieve far exceed the examples in this article, and I will bring more applications of `view transition api` in the future.
