import ThemeToggler from '../../components/ThemeToggler.tsx'

I recently discovered a fun and simple little effect. 
You can preview this effect by clicking on the icon below or the switch theme button in the top right side.

<div style="padding-left: 44px; font-size: 32px;">
  <ThemeToggler client:load />
</div>

> This requires your chrome version >= 111.

This uses the current experimental api: `View Transitions API`. 
Using this, we can simply implement such a beautiful theme switching effect.

## How `View Transitions API` work?

> The following quote is from mdn:

1. When document.startViewTransition() is called, the API takes a screenshot of the current page.
2. Next, the callback passed to is invoked, in this case , 
which causes the DOM to change. When the callback has run successfully, the ViewTransition.updateCallbackDone promise fulfills, allowing you to respond to the DOM updating. startViewTransition()displayNewImage
3. The API captures the new state of the page as a live representation.
4. The API constructs a pseudo-element tree with the following structure:
  ```
  ::view-transition
  └─ ::view-transition-group(root)
    └─ ::view-transition-image-pair(root)
        ├─ ::view-transition-old(root)
        └─ ::view-transition-new(root)
  ```
    - `::view-transition` is the root of view transitions overlay, which contains all view transitions and sits over the top of all other page content.
    - `::view-transition-old` is the screenshot of the old page view, and ::view-transition-new is the live representation of the new page view. 
    Both of these render as replaced content, in the same manner as an `<img>` or `<video>`, meaning that they can be styled with handy properties like object-fit and object-position.
  
<p style="padding-left: 1.2rem;">When the transition animation is about to run, the ViewTransition.ready promise fulfills, 
allowing you to respond by running a custom JavaScript animation instead of the default, for example.</p>

5. The old page view animates from opacity 1 to 0, while the new view animates from 0 to 1, which is what creates the default cross-fade.opacity
6. When the transition animation has reached its end state, the ViewTransition.finished promise fulfills, allowing you to respond.

That is, when calling `document.startViewTransition`, we can then manipulate the `::view-transition-old(root)` pseudo-element to achieve various effects.

## Preparation work

`::view-transitionon-old(root)` and `::view-transition-new(root)` will have a fade-in/out animation by default. 
We need to turn it off for this theme switching effect.

```css
::view-transition-old(root),
::view-transition-new(root) {
  animation: none;
  mix-blend-mode: normal;
}
```

## Document.startViewTransition

Then, we can write our theme toggle logic.

```js
function toggleDark(event) {
  // Get the mouse click position
  const x = event.clientX
  const y = event.clientY
  const endRadius = Math.hypot(
    Math.max(x, innerWidth - x),
    Math.max(y, innerHeight - y),
  )
  // @ts-expect-error: Transition API
  const transition = document.startViewTransition(() => {
    toggle()
  })
  transition.ready
    .then(() => {
      const clipPath = [
        `circle(0px at ${x}px ${y}px)`,
        `circle(${endRadius}px at ${x}px ${y}px)`,
      ]
      document.documentElement.animate(
        {
          clipPath: isDark
            ? [...clipPath].reverse()
            : clipPath,
        },
        {
          duration: 300,
          easing: 'ease-out',
          pseudoElement: isDark
            ? '::view-transition-old(root)'
            : '::view-transition-new(root)',
        },
      )
    })
  
  function toggle() {
    // ... your own switch theme function
  }
}
```

As you can see, the entire logic is very simple and clear, and the `View Transitions API` is very powerful!

You can also achieve this effect in other ways, such as with pure CSS.

This [demo site](https://http203-playlist.netlify.app/) also has a lot of awesome examples of this api, you should check it out!

Hope you enjoy the article.
